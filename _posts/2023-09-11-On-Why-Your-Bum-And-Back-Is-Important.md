Something I feel quite strongly about is making sure that as a Engineer/Developer/Programmer/Whatever term you like to use, is making sure that I am comfortable and not at risk of causing myself pain as I work.

I have recently managed to recover from quite severe back and hip pain brought about by a sub-par engineering workstation. With this in mind I decided it's time to discuss what makes a great office workspace, with comfort and health and the central focus. Productivity will still be a consideration, but I'm a big advocate of the idea that comfortable and healthy engineers do better work.

I won't be advertising brands, nor will I be making explicit suggestions, as each person is different and has different needs, but this should be food for thought for engineers of all experience levels.

**Your chair**

I cannot overstate just how much of a game changer going out and buying a dedicated, comfortable chair for my workstation was for my well-being. Consider that an average full-time engineer might spend upwards of 7 and a half hours (and I hope less, you deserve some non-screen time) at their desk per day.

If you have a chair that is causing you even slight discomfort, thats almost a third of your day (half if you consider average time awake) irritable and prone to chronic injury. Go chair shopping, sit on many chairs, find the chair that is comfortable for your use, and doesn't cause stiffness or soreness after a few hours of using (and those of you who keep things in your back pockets, put them on your desk, your backside will thank you)

**Your bed**

Before I go any further...I am NOT suggesting you work from your bed, I'm the type of person who likes their sleeping space to be just that, a sleeping space.

In the same way that a good chair will help you out, so will a good bed. What 'good' means is wildly different for people, but you want a decent frame that doesn't rock or creak under your (and your partners!) weight, and a mattress suitably firm for your weight and sleeping style.

Plus, who doesn't have a better day hacking after a solid, restful 8 hours?

**Laptop**

Goes without saying, but if you have a say in the matter, make sure your laptop/computer is suitable for your task at hand, and set up correctly.

If you have a machine that is buckling under the weight of the software you're running, its time for you or your employer to upgrade. Hours of productivity can be lost to slow hardware, and being perpetually grumpy at your machine isn't good for your mental health.

**Monitor**

Should go without saying, get monitor(s) that suit your needs. I personally use an ultrawide monitor, but the two monitor setup is ubiqutous for developers. Find monitors the right size to work with with sensible resolutions.

**Audio**

In the modern age (thats now, folks), remote and hybrid working are more common than ever before, and having to listen to someone speaking through horrible, tinny, laptop microphones, or listening to other people through build in laptop speakers does not a good experience make.

Plus, music is great for getting into/staying in a state of flow, if you can tolerate headphones, get a nice pair, consider noise cancelling if you're frequently in a noisy environment.

**Mouse/trackpad**

This might be a hot take, but I CANNOT stand trackpads, especially if you're running a multi-monitor setup, invest in a mouse, doesn't have to be a fancy gaming mouse, but something that fits comfortably in your hand, and had the standard array of buttons (including middle click, and two thumb switches)

**Keyboard**

YMMV, this isn't a big deal for some people, game changer for others. Find a keyboard that is comfortable to use,
